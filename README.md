## 📝 Content Creation Guidelines
To ensure the best experience with StoryBridge, follow these guidelines when creating content:

- *Rich Text* – Use the TipTap editor for formatted content; all text is stored as JSON for flexibility and security
- *Image Uploads* – Upload images directly through the editor; they'll be automatically optimized:
- *Client-side*: Resized to max 1600px, ~80% JPEG quality, <1.2MB
- *Server-side*: Converted to AVIF/WebP with Sharp
- *Special handling*: SVGs pass through, GIFs become animated WebP
- *Read Tracking* – Views are counted once per IP + device combination to ensure accuracy
